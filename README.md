# Temperature-Converter
Basic temperature converter made with Python. Tkinter based (Kelvin, Celsius and Fahrenheit)

I liked this program, is basic but i learned a lot of Tkinter and Python doing it. I like doing converters and this kind of stuff.


SIDE NOTE: I know the code is a bit flunky, i'm kind of new to programming. I'm in coding (for real) for a little bit more than a year. I started with Java and i now doing some codes in Python and absolutely loving it. Please message me if you see something about my code and want to say, i'd appreciate some design suggestions.
