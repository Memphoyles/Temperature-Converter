# Temperature-Converter

Basic temperature converter made with Python and GUI module Tkinter.

Temperatures used -> Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit.

<h3>Executing: </h3>
  
  To run is simple:

  1. Make sure Tkinter module is correctly installed. It normally comes with Python but double check to avoid errors.
  2. Import into your IDE or run directly with cmd: 
      - <i>python tempconverter.py</i>
  
The GUI is pretty intuitive so you shouldn't have problems playing with it if you already used the calculator on Windows.

<h3>Personal note:</h3>

Thanks! This was my first project made with Tkinter, and my first commit to Github back in 2015.
